# Minesweeper
In this project I programmed a classic game: Minesweeper. I started this project 
because I wanted to build a game which is "easy" to implement, but also fun to play. Another reason for this project was to refresh my Javascript skills, especially modules and function factories.

## Functionalities
- Three difficulty levels: Beginner, intermediate, expert (like in the original)
- Ability to flag potential mines
- Timer function

## Challenges
- The most difficult challenge was to implement the "Zeros" that means the tiles which has no adjacent mine in a neighboring tile. It should - like in the original - open all "zero"-tiles automatically to save the user some time. I solved this problem with a recursive function.
- I wanted to recreate the Windows XP design. Unfortunately I could not find free and authentic icons and the font, however it is close enough (especially the smiley) :).
